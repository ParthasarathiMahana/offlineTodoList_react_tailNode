# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### run the npm i command for installing all the required modules.

### I have used "localStorage" for the purpose of persistent storage of data.

### The newly added todo will be added on top of the list.

### If we mark a task as "done" it will move to bottom.

### The tasks which is marked "done" recently will be on top of all the "done tasks".
